	<h2>Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson</h2>
	<p> Exciting read. It was very inspirational seeing how close Elon was to failure at many times. The biggest
		takeaway for me is how Elon always lives his life with a mission, and inspires others with that mission
		as well. The mission being "accelerate the worlds transition to EV's" and "make humans multiplanatory".
		I think having a mission that leads you is extremely powerful. </p>

	<h2>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</h2>
	<p> I never knew that Steve had such an interesting past. The story of him getting kicked out of apple and then
		starting NeXT and Pixar was also inspiring. Similar to Elon he also had a mission, to make great
		products that change everything. The fact that they did not do any product research for the iPhone as
		opposed to most other products was interesting. Had a few tears in my eyes after some points, especially
		after going back and watching the product launches and the 1984 commercial. </p>

	<h2>Sapians</h2>
	<p>
		I loved this book. I often wonder about how amazing the world around us is, and how us humans have built
		all this. Sapians really went through this whole process, all the way from prehistoric times and other
		homo species, to culture and different economic and political systems. The whole idea of everything
		being a common fiction that we all believe in was impactful, for example companies and banks. The
		effectiveness of capitalism was a highlight and how instead of human depending on family and close
		friends for things, now we depend on markets and money. It's amazing that it actually works. The rapid
		change in the last 100 years makes me excited to see what the next 100 years leads to, and I'm glad to
		be alive now. It really is an amazing time to be alive. The last part on the future of humanity
		especially with genetic engineering was also insightful.

	<h2>Player of Games by Ian Banks</h2>
	<p>
		What a wild ride. This book made me excited about the future. The flying drones and have AGI and help
		humans was fascinating and exciting. Living a multiplanitary life was also inspiring. Another takeaway
		was that having life dictated by a game only and solely playing to win based on the game is not a good
		idea.
	</p>

	<h2>The Foundations</h2>
	<p>
		I didn't enjoy the short stories aspect of this book. Everytime I actually started to really enjoy the
		story it ended and a new one started. I really liked the first three though, haven't read the last one
		yet. The whole idea of psychohistory, using math to predict the future, was pretty cool, so I will say
		that. Also note that this book was way ahead of its time.
	</p>

	<h2>Siddhartha</h2>
	<p>
		On the shorter side, but a really impactful story. I enjoyed the his journey and the different stages of
		his life and related to him a bit a well.
