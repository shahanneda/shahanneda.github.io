            I'm a passionate computer science student who loves building and tinkering with new things!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm deeply involved in various initiaitves at Waterloo:<br> - I'm a tech lead at <a
              href="https://uwblueprint.org">UW
              Blueprint</a>, where we build tech for non-profits.

            our self driving car stack, using UE4 (Carla), ROS, Docker, and building 3D assets using NeRF's.
            </br>
            - I'm the web development lead of <a href="https://csclub.ca">University of Waterloo's CS Club</a>. I've
            lead
            our team to build various tools and services for students using React, Typescript, PostgresSQL, NodeJS, and
            more. Some projects I led include our <a href="https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/classprofile/2022"> class profile
            </a>,
            automatic membership verification and more. As the team lead, I designed the architecture of our systems,
            setup
            automatic CI and deployment using Docker and Kubernetes, screened resumes, conducted over 10 technical
            interviews, mentored new developers and more.

              highly successful YCombinator
              backed startup</a>, both as a FE and BE Engineer. As a FE engineer I built a series of post order
            communications using React and Typescript that currently get used over 2.16 million times per
            month and increased confirmed dollars ordered by $200,000 per month (evidenced through an A/B test). I also
            lead multiple large scale changes and created various tooling that save hours of toil every month.
            As a BE engineer I led a multi-team project involving FE, BE, mobile, and external vendors from
            scoping to release, which is currently active on every new sign up at Faire. I wrote an article about this
            internship and what I built on <a href="https://shahan.ca/article"> Faire's technical blog!</a>

          <p>
            I really enjoy staying active, especially by playing tennis, let me know if you're ever up for a match!
            When it comes to music, my taste involves a lot of different era's, especially classical music, Jazz, and
            Billy
            Joel. More than just listening, I love to play piano, and sometimes dabble in composing my own pieces as
            well!

                post math lessons for students from all around the world to access. While making this I made several
                important design choices which was guided by my goal for the math content to be as reliable as possible.
                The actual math content is hosted on GitHub Pages (which is highly reliable) in JSON, the teacher edits
                the content through an admin login page, which automatically saves their changes by committing to
                GitHub. This way, once a lesson is published, it will always be available forever, even if my backend
                server (hosted on Heroku) goes down. Some other interesting features are image uploading using amazon
                S3, and an interactive WYSIWYG latex editing for entering equations in the lessons.
